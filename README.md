# MazeSolvingReinforcementLearning
 A maze solving algorithm built in C# using Unity and based on Reinforcement Learning model built from scratch.


This is a project built by my team and I for our senior capstone project. The model's logic is based on a Reinforcement Learning model we built from scratch. We have incorporated data collection methods which read and write data from each session. My focus was solely on the Machine Learning aspects of the project, as well as gameplay. Becaues of the virute of the way the class was structured, we did not spend much time writing documentation for our classes and functions. Feel free to message me in regards to any functionality. We also did not spend a great deal of time optimizing our methods, we have put in place a space reduction method which reduces the search space of some of our functions, but this is not entirely necessary to run.
