# MazeSolvingReinforcementLearning
 A maze solving algorithm built in C# using Unity and based on Reinforcement Learning model built from scratch.


This project was built by my team and I for our senior capstone project.The model's logic is based on a Reinforcement Learning model we built from scratch. We have incorporated data collection methods which read and write data from each session. My focus was solely on the Machine Learning aspects of the project, as well as gameplay.
